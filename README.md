## Module 2 Week 4 Plotting! Lesson: Show what you have Learned.  There are 3 files.  
### First, matplotlib 3D plot of a mathematical function f(x, y) = sin(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)).  When I was in college, I would have to use MATLAB in order to get this kind plot.  It wasn't as easy as this was.
- I was greatly assisted by the website https://codevisionz.com/lessons/matplotlib-create-a-3d-surface-plot/

### Second file is Bar Graph Vertical
### Libraries used.  Each library offered a different way to do the graphs.
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly - give the ability to hover over each bar to display a box with info related it.

### For the next two files, I got a huge amount of help thru GeeksforGeeks.org Live online class
- It was a 3 day class with each day 2 hours each.
- It was a shear coincidence that I got an email on Tuesday 05/13/2025 about a Data Analysis Class
- It was over Zoom.  It was actually live from India 8:00pm their time.
- It was very helpful on Wednesday and Thursday showing everything we have been doing.
- Friday was a review and on how the get the same plots using AI ChatGPT and Google Gemini.  It interesting but not like actual figuring out the code
- It was also benefical to help with learning Mardown and showed how to use Google colab.

### Third file is Pie Charts
### Libraries used
- Pandas
- matplotlib
